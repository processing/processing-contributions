  sentence: Assists creation of data visualization sketches.
  paragraph: Includes color utilities, statistical graphics, morphing classes, spatial
    utilities and map projections, force-directed layouts and text input/output. Together
    these make the task of creating data visualization sketches much faster by providing
    code for commonly repeated tasks such as zooming in and out of a sketch, setting
    up color tables etc. For documentation and examples, see the [gicentreUtils pages](http://www.gicentre.org/utils/).

    language (like Python, and the Linux bash terminal) would. The console also provides
    options to undo commands, to convert the valid commands entered so far into a
    function, and so on. Ths mode also gives the PDE the ability to hot swap code,
    wherein the output corresponding to changes made in a running sketch can be viewed
    by simply saving the sketch, without restarting it.

  sentence: Import data and manipulate it with statistical and other functions. Designed
    to be simple to use for novice programmers while being highly flexible and extensible.
    Includes many examples and tutorials. Check out olivercoleman.github.io/hivis
    for a 30 second crash course.
  paragraph: Typically raw data is loaded from a data source, for example a spreadsheet,
    and then <strong>views</strong> of that data are derived from it via transformation
    operations or functions. Some example views are mathematical and statistical operations,
    filtering and rearranging elements of the data, sorting and grouping data, or
    applying a function to every element of the data. Custom views can be created
    too. If the data source changes, the derived views are updated in real-time.

  sentence: Calculation of mouse coordinates in transformed 2D animation matrices.
  paragraph: Processing's reserved keywords "mouseX" & "mouseY" store the mouse coordinates
    with respect to the upper left corner of the sketch. When no transformations (i.e.
    translate(), scale(), rotate(), pushMatrix(), popMatrix()) are applied, these
    coordinates refer to the actual position in the animation matrix. However, when
    transformations are applied, this relation no longer holds. With this library,
    one can get the actual position of the mouse in both transformed and non transformed
    animation matrices.

  sentence: A class and collection of utilities for complex numbers.
  paragraph: A complex number is a linear combination of 1 and i (the square root
    of -1), such as 2+3i, 8+7i, -1-i, 2-2.8i, or -1.863+4.211i.  The term with the
    i is called the imaginary part, while the term without the i is called the real
    part.  Complex numbers allow for many things that wouldn't otherwise be possible
    using only real numbers (numbers without an imaginary part).  By allowing you
    to square root negative numbers, complex numbers open up a whole new world of
    possibilities, while still conserving most fundamental math rules we've come to
    accept with real numbers.
