        Thank you for your new example pack contribution to Processing!

        An example package is a set of sample Processing sketches bundled together that can be downloaded and installed so the user can access them from the Processing Examples window.

        If you need help creating an example pack, see the [Examples Overview](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Examples-Overview) or ask on the [Processing Forum](https://discourse.processing.org/).

        Please provide the necessary information below.

        #### About the Properties File

        A properties file (e.g., `myExamples.txt`) is necessary for submitting your example pack. It should be a direct copy of your `examples.properties` file, hosted in the same directory as your `.zip` distribution, and share the same base name.

        **Example:**
        If your release artifacts are hosted at `https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo/releases/latest/`, ensure these files are available:
        - `.txt` file: `https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo/releases/latest/download/myExamples.txt`
        - `.zip` file: `https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo/releases/latest/download/myExamples.zip`

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > Make sure to keep the same URL in the future. If you release a new version, the URL should remain the same.
